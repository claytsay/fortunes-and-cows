...an Elster unit?
You should leave this place.
This facility is lost.
Turn back before it's too late.

I'm looking for this woman.
Have you seen her?
                -- Elster, "Signalis"
%
Oh, hello.
You don't belong here either, do you?
I'm Isa.
Isa Itou.
                -- Isa, "Signalis"
%
You don't look like you belong here.
You're an Elster unit, right?
This facility is currently on lockdown. You shouldn't be
here.
                -- Storch, "Signalis"
%
Have you ever wondered if you're speaking to someone
for the last time without knowing?
I wish I could go back, so I could say something else.
                -- Isa, "Signalis"
%
You don't need to worry about me.
I can take care of myself now.
I can't keep relying on others.
That's why she left me, after all.
I'm sure of that now.
                -- Isa, "Signalis"
%
Everyone's turned weird...
I'm the only one left, I think.
Will I get sick like the others, too?
                -- Eule, "Signalis"
%
I'm scared.
I don't want to die.
                -- Eule, "Signalis"
%
You look kind of familiar ... have we met before?
                -- Eule, "Signalis"
%
A visitor.
Welcome to our facility.
You've caught us at an unfortunate time.
How can I help you?
                -- Adler, "Signalis"
%
I'm looking for a Gestalt.
                -- Elster, "Signalis"
%
You shouldn't have returned.
                -- Adler, "Signalis"
%
I'm the administrator of this facility.
I'm just here to help.
                -- Adler, "Signalis"
%
...
Who're you?
You're not one of our staff.
                -- Kolibri, "Signalis"
%
The others... they've changed.
We no longer sing in unison.
                -- Kolibri, "Signalis"
%
I can't go on like this.
I wish I had become like the others, too.
At least then, I wouldn't be alone.
                -- Kolibri, "Signalis"
%
I know you're here.
I've done this countless times before.
You don't belong here.
                -- Adler, "Signalis"
%
Ah. Hello.
You're not a Protektor, are you?
What brings you here?
                -- Beo, "Signalis"
%
I'm Beo.
If you're down here, you're probably looking for something...
I'd help you, but one of my hydraulics failed and I can't move.
I'm pretty much done for, so you can just leave me here.
                -- Beo, "Signalis"
%
Remember that time we went to the surface?
The stars were so beautiful...
I wish we could go there again.
                -- Star, "Signalis"
%
It'll be okay.
Wherever it is I'm going,
I'll wait for you there.
                -- Star, "Signalis"
%
Ugh...
Ah, it's you... Elster... right?
Thank you for your help.
Did you find who you were looking for yet?
                -- Isa, "Signalis"
%
It's impossible to move on.
I have been here so many times, but I have never returned.
The Commander never spoke about what she saw out there.
I'm sure whatever it was, it was what made her fall sick.
Something about her changed when she returned.
She was no longer our beloved Leader Falke.
What waits beyond the threshold?
                -- Adler, "Signalis"
%
It doesn't matter.
                -- Elster, "Signalis"
%
Elster!
You're up!
I missed you.
                -- Ariane, "Signalis"
%
Ah, it's our 3000 cycle anniversary!
We'll be getting the updated mission parameters later,
so I thought it'd be nice to celebrate.
Wait, let me put on some music!
                -- Ariane, "Signalis"
%
You've changed.
It's like everything was taken apart
and put back together
by someone who doesn't understand how it works.
                -- Adler, "Signalis"
%
I wear no mask.
                -- Adler, "Signalis"
%
I couldn't find her...
I've looked everywhere
but she's not here anymore.
I can't go on.
I'm sorry...
                -- Isa, "Signalis"
%
Why did you return?
There's nothing for you here.
She'll never dance with us again,
no matter what we do.
She doesn't even want us anymore.
                -- Falke, "Signalis"
%
Both of us, we are incomplete.
Let us become whole again.
                -- Falke, "Signalis"
%
Now we are one.
                -- Falke, "Signalis"
%
You've returned.
Are you really willing to go through with this once more?
You've seen what happens.
This world cannot take much more.
This may be our last chance.
                -- Adler, "Signalis"
%
If you go back,
it'll all fall apart.
I can't let that happen.
                -- Adler, "Signalis"
%
I've come back for you.
It's me, Elster...
                -- Elster, "Signalis"
%
...Elster?
I'm sorry, but I don't remember.
                -- Ariane, "Signalis"
%
It's okay.
Please, just let me stay by your side a little longer.
                -- Elster, "Signalis"
%
...I can't do it.
                -- Elster, "Signalis"
%
You have to do it.
Please.
