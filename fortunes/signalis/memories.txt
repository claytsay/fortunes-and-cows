Erika,

if you find this note,
despite everything that's happened,
I've come to look for you.

A slow accumulation of reproduction errors - a gradual corruption of information - a
story, misremembered, slowly morphing with each retelling - like genetic material,
mutating and evolving - like the Replika mind, copied over and over from an aging
template?

     it calls me
  in a sea of flesh
  we will become one
but i can never go back
     to being me

Those who sing the same song
have heard it in their dreams.
A dark tone, at the edge of hearing
A silent voice, whispering to my heart:
%
       Come join us
Together we will be eternal
    There is no escape
      We will be one.
%
But I fear the dark sea
 that will swallow me
%
Those of us who can
hear its call in the night.
An invitation.

An ocean of memories, where "I" ends and
"We" begin.
%
we should have never left
the primordial soup
only through death can i escape
the call of the one who rules
above all life
%

I now believe it was not an infection diseas, nor some for of poison or radiation - it
was a slow corruption of reality itself. As I've relived the same cycle over and over,
each time details changed, things are twisted, added, removed...
How long until it all turns to nothing but noise?
%
A crashed ship
A strange gate
A hole in the ground.
%
An island beyond reach
Memories fro other lives
dreams of suffering and loneliness.
A promise.
A seach for someone lost.
%
I saw her, in the red emptiness, waiting for me.
We had made a promise.
As the memories of a stranger rushed into my mind,
I felt the borders of my self blur.
%
Now I can longer tell
where "Falke" ends and "Elster" begins.
%
We were dancing
     to that song
	      they start the broadcast with
%
We fell asleep
     watching that movie
	      we had seen before so many times
%
if only
     I could take us back
	      to that time
		       when we were happy
%
These memories
     are mine now.

Cycle 225
When I signed up for this mission, I just wanted to get away from everything.
I was sick of Rotfront, of school, of the photo store.
Sick of the fake smiles and the whispering behind people's backs.
%
When I saw the photo of that soldier, I wondered who she was.
Was she happy? Was her family proud of her? Did her comrades love her?
Since we looked alike, could I have been like her?
But in the end, I just wanted to leave.
%
Nothing I had done or made ever meant anything to anyone, so why bother?
Here, I am finally free.
I get to be by myself, and to do what I want.
I can finally be happy.
%
Cycle 648
Talked some more to the Elster unit.
She's different from the Replikas I knew back home, nothing like my teachers or the
Blockwart Protektor. I know she didn't have a choice, but it feels like she's also here
because she didn't fit in. It's like we've run away from the world together.
%
At first, I didn't like having someone around, and I was glad that she's quiet and didn't approach me. But lately, I've missed having someone I can talk to. It's been so long since
I've last seen another person.
%
I never thought I'd miss it. Except her, everything is the same in here, always.
Nothing ever changes.
%
Cycle 1840
Everything is always the same.
I feel like I'm trapped inside this ship.
I know every bolt on every panel in every room of it.
I've seen everything, I've done everything there is to do in here.
%
I can't concentrate on anything.
It's like there's this fog inside my head,
and whenever I try to do anything, I just can't focus.
I want to go outside, I want to breathe fresh air,
I want to feel wind on my face and in my hair.
%
Cycle 2503
I think I lost more hair.
I'm sitting here, getting older.
Every time I wake up, I feel older, weaker, sicker.
I get out of breath so easily lately, and my back hurts when I sit down.
How much longer will this go on? It feels like I'm just slowly dying...
%
Cycle 5▒▒9
I'm tired of it all.
Every time I go to sleep, I wonder if I'll wake up again.
I'm scared that it'll be the last time I said good night to her.
Did I say it right? Will she be okay?
What if one of us just won't wake up tomorrow?
%
Cycle 54▒▒
I don't want to die,
I don't want to live anymore either.
Everything is just so exhausting.
I just want to lie down and disappear.
%
Cycle ▒▒▒▒▒▒
i just want to sleep
please just let me sleep

please just make it stop

please
