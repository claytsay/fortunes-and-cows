So many people are. Afraid of firemen, I mean.
But you're just a man, after all ...

It’s fine work. Monday burn Millay, Wednesday Whitman, Friday Faulkner,
burn ’em to ashes, then burn the ashes. That’s our official slogan.

Have you seen the two hundred-foot-long billboards in the country beyond town?
Did you know that once billboards were only twenty feet long? But cars started
rushing by so quickly they had to stretch the advertising out so it would last.

My uncle says his grandfather remembered when children didn’t kill each other.
But that was a long time ago when they had things different. They believed in
responsibility, my uncle says.

You know the law, where’s your common sense? None of those books agree with
each other. You’ve been locked up here for years with a regular damned Tower
of Babel. Snap out of it! The people in those books never lived. Come on now!

The zipper displaces the button and a man lacks just that much time to think
while dressing at dawn, a philosophical hour, and thus a melancholy hour.

Surely you remember the boy in your own school class who was exceptionally
‘bright,’ did most of the reciting and answering while the others sat like
so many leaden idols, hating him. And wasn’t it this bright boy you selected
for beatings and tortures after hours? Of course it was.

We must all be alike. Not everyone born free and equal,

We’re the Happiness Boys, the Dixie Duo, you and I and the others.
We stand against the small tide of those who want to make everyone
unhappy with conflicting theory and thought.

He’s right. Happiness is important. Fun is everything. And yet I kept
sitting there saying to myself, I’m not happy, I’m not happy.

It’s an insidious plan, if I do say so myself. To see the firehouses burn
across the land, destroyed as hotbeds of treason. The salamander devours
his tail! Ho, God!

Man, when I was younger I shoved my ignorance in people’s faces. They beat
me with sticks. By the time I was forty my blunt instrument had been honed
to a fine cutting point for me.

For everyone nowadays knows, absolutely is _certain_, that nothing 
will ever happen to _me_. Others die, _I_ go on. There are no 
consequences and no responsibilities. Except that there _are_.

Give a man a few lines of verse and he thinks he’s the Lord of all Creation.
You think you can walk on water with your books. Well, the world can get by
just fine without them.

But you can’t _make_ people listen. They have to come round in their own time,
wondering what happened and why the world blew up under them. It can’t last.
