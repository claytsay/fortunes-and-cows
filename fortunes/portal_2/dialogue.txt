Some emergency testing may require prolonged interaction with lethal military
androids.  Rest assured that all lethal military androids have been taught to

All right, I've been thinking. When life gives you lemons? Don't make
lemonade. Make life take the lemons back! Get mad! 'I don't want your
damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these?'

self destruct in about six minutes. Pretty sure it's a problem with the light.

Look for a switch that says 'escape pod,' alright? Don't touch anything else.
